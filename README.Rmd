**NOTE** ℹ️: This is the repository for the companion package to our paper @altmeyer2021deep. We recently presented our paper at the [NeurIPS 2021 MLECON workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/ScheduleMultitrack?event=21847). For the specific code used for the paper and additional resources please see [this repository](https://github.com/pat-alt/deepvarsMacro).

## `deepvars`

The `deepvars` package provides a framework for Deep Vector Autoregression in R. The methodology is based on [@altmeyer2021deep], a working paper initially prepared as part of the [Masters Degree in Data Science](https://bse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science-methodology) at [Barcelona School of Economics](https://bse.eu). For a summary of the first version of the working paper see [here](https://thevoice.bse.eu/2021/09/16/deep-vector-autoregression-for-macroeconomic-data/).

## Installation

You can either clone this repository and install from source or simply run the below in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("pat-alt/deepvars", build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(deepvars)
```

## Getting started

Full documentation of the package is still a work-in-progress. In the meantime, detailed guidance on different topics and estimation methods covered by `deepvars`, can be found in the vignettes. Simply type the following command once you have completed the steps above:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
utils::browseVignettes('deepvars')
```

## Disclaimer

*Date*: 1 Februar, 2022.

This package was developed in tandem with the initial research for my masters thesis. Documentation is incomplete and it should at this point **not** be regarded as a fully-fledged, tested and production-ready piece of software, so please bear this in mind. That being said, I'm quite confident about the basic functionality of training and predicting from a Deep VAR as well as various plotting methods that can be used for visualizing the results. I encourage you to try it out yourself and should you encounter any problem, please just open an issue.
